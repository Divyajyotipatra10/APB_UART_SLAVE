# APB_UART_SLAVE
This project implements a UART communication system with APB interface using Verilog. It includes TX/RX FIFOs, supports loopback testing, and integrates a testbench for verification. Designed for modular use in SoCs or FPGA systems, it enables reliable serial data transfer without register-level details.
